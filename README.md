Whova Accessibility Fix
==============================

This user script was created on behalf of the 2020 [Accessing Higher Ground][] conference 
to fix the highest priority accessibility issues in the Whova web app. It was based entirely on this one conference experience; it has not been tested with other events that use the Whova app.  

Issues Addressed by this Script
---------------------------------------

* Adds headings
* Adds ARIA landmarks
* Adds unique titles for each page
* Changes clickable div elements into buttons and makes them keyboard-focusable
* Adds alt text to informative images, and empty alt to decorative images
* Improves accessibility of chat interfaces using ARIA live regions
* As a user filters results by typing into a search field or selecting other filters, a message is written to an ARIA live region indicating the new results count.  

How to Use This Script
----------------------

Instructions coming soon.  

Contributing
-------------------

I welcome contributions, and particularly encourage AHG attendees to help make the conference more accessible! 
I'll be working to improve the script throughout the conference, which ends November 19, 2020. If you'd like to help, just let me know. I can be reached by email at [tft@uw.edu][] or via Twitter, [@terrillthompson][]. 

Or simply submit a pull request.
